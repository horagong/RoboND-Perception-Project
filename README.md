## Project: Perception Pick & Place
---


# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Extract features and train an SVM model on new objects (see `pick_list_*.yaml` in `/pr2_robot/config/` for the list of models you'll be trying to identify). 
2. Write a ROS node and subscribe to `/pr2/world/points` topic. This topic contains noisy point cloud data that you must work with.
3. Use filtering and RANSAC plane fitting to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the scene.
4. Apply Euclidean clustering to create separate clusters for individual items.
5. Perform object recognition on these objects and assign them labels (markers in RViz).
6. Calculate the centroid (average in x, y and z) of the set of points belonging to that each object.
7. Create ROS messages containing the details of each object (name, pick_pose, etc.) and write these messages out to `.yaml` files, one for each of the 3 scenarios (`test1-3.world` in `/pr2_robot/worlds/`).  [See the example `output.yaml` for details on what the output should look like.](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/pr2_robot/config/output.yaml)  
8. Submit a link to your GitHub repo for the project or the Python code for your perception pipeline and your output `.yaml` files (3 `.yaml` files, one for each test world).  You must have correctly identified 100% of objects from `pick_list_1.yaml` for `test1.world`, 80% of items from `pick_list_2.yaml` for `test2.world` and 75% of items from `pick_list_3.yaml` in `test3.world`.
9. Congratulations!  Your Done!

# Extra Challenges: Complete the Pick & Place
7. To create a collision map, publish a point cloud to the `/pr2/3d_map/points` topic and make sure you change the `point_cloud_topic` to `/pr2/3d_map/points` in `sensors.yaml` in the `/pr2_robot/config/` directory. This topic is read by Moveit!, which uses this point cloud input to generate a collision map, allowing the robot to plan its trajectory.  Keep in mind that later when you go to pick up an object, you must first remove it from this point cloud so it is removed from the collision map!
8. Rotate the robot to generate collision map of table sides. This can be accomplished by publishing joint angle value(in radians) to `/pr2/world_joint_controller/command`
9. Rotate the robot back to its original state.
10. Create a ROS Client for the “pick_place_routine” rosservice.  In the required steps above, you already created the messages you need to use this service. Checkout the [PickPlace.srv](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project/tree/master/pr2_robot/srv) file to find out what arguments you must pass to this service.
11. If everything was done correctly, when you pass the appropriate messages to the `pick_place_routine` service, the selected arm will perform pick and place operation and display trajectory in the RViz window
12. Place all the objects from your pick list in their respective dropoff box and you have completed the challenge!
13. Looking for a bigger challenge?  Load up the `challenge.world` scenario and see if you can get your perception pipeline working there!

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented
#### From Exercise 1 and 2 steps, pipeline for filtering, RANSAC plane fitting and clustering for segmentaion are implemented.
```
# Load Point Cloud file
cloud = pcl.load_XYZRGB('tabletop.pcd')

# Statistical Outlier filter ------------------------------------
outlier_filter = cloud_filtered.make_statistical_outlier_filter()

# Set the number of neighboring points to analyze for any given point
outlier_filter.set_mean_k(50)

# Set threshold scale factor
x = 1.0

# Any point with a mean distance larger than global (mean distance+x*std_dev) will be considered outlier
outlier_filter.set_std_dev_mul_thresh(x)

# Finally call the filter function for magic
cloud_filtered = outlier_filter.filter()

# Voxel Grid filter ----------------------------------------
# Create a VoxelGrid filter object for our input point cloud
vox = cloud.make_voxel_grid_filter()

# Choose a voxel (also known as leaf) size
# Note: this (1) is a poor choice of leaf size   
# Experiment and find the appropriate size!
LEAF_SIZE = 0.01   

# Set the voxel (or leaf) size  
vox.set_leaf_size(LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE)

# Call the filter function to obtain the resultant downsampled point cloud
cloud_filtered = vox.filter()
filename = 'voxel_downsampled.pcd'
pcl.save(cloud_filtered, filename)

# PassThrough filter ----------------------------------------
# Create a PassThrough filter object.

# Assign axis and range to the passthrough filter object.
filter_axis = 'z'
passthrough.set_filter_field_name(filter_axis)

tree = white_cloud.make_kdtree()

# Create a cluster extraction object
ec = white_cloud.make_EuclideanClusterExtraction()
# Set tolerances for distance threshold
# as well as minimum and maximum cluster size (in points)
# NOTE: These are poor choices of clustering parameters
# Your task is to experiment and find values that work for segmenting objects.
ec.set_ClusterTolerance(0.02)
ec.set_MinClusterSize(10)
ec.set_MaxClusterSize(1250)
# Search the k-d tree for clusters
ec.set_SearchMethod(tree)
# Extract indices for each of the discovered clusters
cluster_indices = ec.Extract()

# Create Cluster-Mask Point Cloud to visualize each cluster separately
# Assign a color corresponding to each segmented object in scene
cluster_color = get_color_list(len(cluster_indices))

color_cluster_point_list = []

for j, indices in enumerate(cluster_indices):
    for i, indice in enumerate(indices):

# Create new cloud containing all clusters, each with unique color
cluster_cloud = pcl.PointCloud_PointXYZRGB()
cluster_cloud.from_list(color_cluster_point_list)

# Convert PCL data to ROS messages
ros_cloud_objects = pcl_to_ros(cloud_objects)
ros_cloud_table = pcl_to_ros(cloud_table)
ros_cluster_cloud = pcl_to_ros(cluster_cloud)


# Publish ROS messages

#### From Exercise 3 Steps, object recoginition is implemented.

        ros_cluster = pcl_to_ros(pcl_cluster)

        # Extract histogram features
        # DONE: complete this step just as is covered in capture_features.py
        chists = compute_color_histograms(ros_cluster, using_hsv=False)
        normals = get_normals(ros_cluster)
        nhists = compute_normal_histograms(normals)

        # Compute the associated feature vector
        feature = np.concatenate((chists, nhists))

        # Make the prediction, retrieve the label for the result
        # and add it to detected_objects_labels list
        prediction = clf.predict(scaler.transform(feature.reshape(1,-1)))
        label = encoder.inverse_transform(prediction)[0]
        detected_objects_labels.append(label)

        # Publish a label into RViz
        label_pos = list(white_cloud[pts_list[0]])
        label_pos[2] += .4
        object_markers_pub.publish(make_label(label,label_pos, index))

        detected_objects.append(do)

        # Add the centroid for pick and place
        centroid = np.mean(pcl_cluster.to_array(), axis=0)[:3]
        detected_objects_dict.setdefault(label, []).append(centroid)

    rospy.loginfo('Detected {} objects: {}'.format(len(detected_objects_labels), detected_objects_labels))
    # Publish the list of detected objects
    # This is the output you'll need to complete the upcoming project!
    detected_objects_pub.publish(detected_objects)
```
For object recognition, features are extracted using `compute_color_histograms` and `compute_normal_histograms` in sensor_stick/features.py.

        if using_hsv:
            point_colors_list.append(rgb_to_hsv(rgb_list) * 255)
        else:
            point_colors_list.append(rgb_list)

    # Populate lists with color values
    channel_1_vals = []
    channel_2_vals = []
    channel_3_vals = []

    for color in point_colors_list:
        channel_1_vals.append(color[0])
        channel_2_vals.append(color[1])
        channel_3_vals.append(color[2])
    
    # DONE: Compute histograms
    r_hist = np.histogram(channel_1_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))

    b_hist = np.histogram(channel_3_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))

    # DONE: Concatenate and normalize the histograms
    hist_features = np.concatenate((r_hist[0], g_hist[0], b_hist[0])).astype(np.float64)
    norm_features = hist_features / np.sum(hist_features)

    # Generate random features for demo mode.

    return norm_features
```
I also modified sensor_stick/catpure_features.py to have new training models for the project and to increase the number of the test data.
```
models = [\
       'biscuits',
       'book',
       'snacks',
       'eraser',
       'glue',
       'sticky_notes',
       'soap',
       'soap2']
...
num_of_test_data = 100
for model_name in models:
    spawn_model(model_name)
    
    for i in range(num_of_test_data):
```
And SVM classifier is trained like this.
```
# It launches cloud_transformer and feature_extractor node
roslaunch sensor_stick training.launch

# While launching training.launch
rosrun sensor_stick capture_features.py

# read training_set.sav and write model.sav
rosrun sensor_stick train_svm.py
```
The result was like this.
![svm](images/svm.png)

### Pick and Place Setup

#### 1. For all three tabletop setups (`test*.world`), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (`pick_list_*.yaml`). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid `PickPlace` request output them to `.yaml` format.
Object recognition is performed according to test_scene_num and the PickPlace request output is saved in output_$(arg test_scene_num).yaml.
```
roslaunch pr2_robot pick_place_project.launch test_scene_num:=1
  
rosrun pr2_robot project_template.py
```
The results are 100%, 80% and 100% in test_scene_num 1,2,3 respectively.
![scene1](images/scene1.png)
![scene2](images/scene2.png)
![scene3](images/scene3.png)

I think the accuracy would be increased with the larger number of test data and tuning parameters of SVM.

# 3D Perception
Before starting any work on this project, please complete all steps for [Exercise 1, 2 and 3](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Exercises). At the end of Exercise-3 you have a pipeline that can identify points that belong to a specific object.

In this project, you must assimilate your work from previous exercises to successfully complete a tabletop pick and place operation using PR2.

The PR2 has been outfitted with an RGB-D sensor much like the one you used in previous exercises. This sensor however is a bit noisy, much like real sensors.

Given the cluttered tabletop scenario, you must implement a perception pipeline using your work from Exercises 1,2 and 3 to identify target objects from a so-called “Pick-List” in that particular order, pick up those objects and place them in corresponding dropboxes.

# Project Setup
For this setup, catkin_ws is the name of active ROS Workspace, if your workspace name is different, change the commands accordingly
If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the src directory of your workspace:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project.git
```
### Note: If you have the Kinematics Pick and Place project in the same ROS Workspace as this project, please remove the 'gazebo_grasp_plugin' directory from the `RoboND-Perception-Project/` directory otherwise ignore this note. 

Now install missing dependencies using rosdep install:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
```
Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
Add following to your .bashrc file
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
```

If you haven’t already, following line can be added to your .bashrc to auto-source all new terminals
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To run the demo:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/scripts
$ chmod u+x pr2_safe_spawner.sh
$ ./pr2_safe_spawner.sh
```
![demo-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20687560/28748231-46b5b912-7467-11e7-8778-3095172b7b19.png)



Once Gazebo is up and running, make sure you see following in the gazebo world:
- Robot

- Table arrangement

- Three target objects on the table

- Dropboxes on either sides of the robot


If any of these items are missing, please report as an issue on [the waffle board](https://waffle.io/udacity/robotics-nanodegree-issues).

In your RViz window, you should see the robot and a partial collision map displayed:

![demo-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20687560/28748286-9f65680e-7468-11e7-83dc-f1a32380b89c.png)

Proceed through the demo by pressing the ‘Next’ button on the RViz window when a prompt appears in your active terminal

The demo ends when the robot has successfully picked and placed all objects into respective dropboxes (though sometimes the robot gets excited and throws objects across the room!)

Close all active terminal windows using **ctrl+c** before restarting the demo.

You can launch the project scenario like this:
```sh
$ roslaunch pr2_robot pick_place_project.launch
```

For all the step-by-step details on how to complete this project see the [RoboND 3D Perception Project Lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/586e8e81-fc68-4f71-9cab-98ccd4766cfe/modules/e5bfcfbd-3f7d-43fe-8248-0c65d910345a/lessons/e3e5fd8e-2f76-4169-a5bc-5a128d380155/concepts/802deabb-7dbb-46be-bf21-6cb0a39a1961)
Note: The robot is a bit moody at times and might leave objects on the table or fling them across the room :D
As long as your pipeline performs succesful recognition, your project will be considered successful even if the robot feels otherwise!
